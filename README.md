  ## Installation
  Node.js and npm express are required to run the server for this project. With Node and npm installed, clone this repo, and in the parent folder containing server.js, run 'npm i' to install dependencies. 

  ## Usage
  With dependencies installed, it is as easy as running 'npm start' in the parent folder containing server.js. The console will log when the server starts and what port. Then in a browser head to localhost:`your-port` and check out the project! Type to create and when there is text in both fields a save button will render to save the note! Click on notes in the left sidebar to view them.
